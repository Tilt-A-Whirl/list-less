# list:less

For months now, I've wanted a grocery list app that would allow me 
to save separate lists and then just select the lists I wanted to 
be added to my master shopping list, along with allowing me to add 
any additional items not saved in a separate 'recipe' list (paper 
towels, trash bags, etc.). I've had mobile apps that come close to 
this, but only by letting me save multiple lists and then going no 
further; they never gave me the ability to select lists to be included 
and then compile all my items into one master list. So when i needed 
a good project to get me started in ember.js, this seemed like a good 
place to start.

Note: This app uses fixture data
